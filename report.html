  <h2>Experiment: "Touchpad vs. Mouse "</h2>
  <h4>Author: Alden Maben</h4>
  <h4>Summary</h4>
  <p>For this Fitts Law Experiment, we tested the r value as well as the average throughput between a touch pard and mouse. The participants included my brother and me. We used my laptop(Mackbook Pro 2016) and my gaming mouse(default settings). I went through the tests(Touchpad and mouse) first, followed by my brother. We were not surprised looking at the results for throughput as we both had a theory that the mouse would outperform a touchpad. We were surprised by our r value because our r values had flipped between each other. This showed how our experience in one form of input can put us either in an advantage or disadvantage. </p>
